<p>Richmond Website.</p> 
<p>  my name is Tano Richmond Owusu Ansah .I was born in Sampa Government Hospital, and also I am 24 years of age,we are three in number but am the firs born in my family.
<P> I grew up in a town called sampa.later in adolescence stage, I was an active member of my Junior High School counsel. After completing my Junior education, i continued my education to the Senior High level which was T.I Amass Fomena Senior High School.</p> 
<p> I was discipline in all aspect. After my completion in the Senior High School, i applied for an admission to enroll into the University of Ghana as a I.T.</P>
<p> I am currently in University of Ghana offering Bsc in Information Technology(I.T). My main goal is to become someone who has more knowledge in technology so that i will be able to cope myself in the world. 
<p> The main reason why I want to pursue a degree in Bsc in Infomation Technology at the University of Ghana is that; i will be able to help others in the Ghana.
<p>  I study hard because without a degree I can not achieve these goals.
